/**
 * The mark for whoever said something.
 *
 * Shape carries kind: a person is a rounded square, the agent a circle. That
 * has to hold everywhere at once, because the same person appears in a chat
 * entry, in the presence stack and in the header — drawn separately per surface
 * it becomes one person with two shapes on one screen, which is exactly how the
 * two copies this replaces came to disagree. So there is one of each here and
 * the size is the only thing a caller chooses, set by the row it sits in.
 *
 * The photograph takes the same shape as the fallback. If a loaded face were
 * round and a failed one square, the shape would report whether github.com
 * answered rather than who is speaking — and a person with a photograph would
 * be the same shape as the agent.
 *
 * No lettering. Initials were 8px inside a 20px mark and the scale now stops at
 * 13px, so they either sat off the scale or the mark grew to 28px and took that
 * width from every message in the rail. Identity rests on the photograph, the
 * shape, the account colour and the name — which is beside the mark everywhere
 * except the presence stack, where hovering is the only way to tell two people
 * on neighbouring account colours apart.
