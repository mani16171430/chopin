/**
 * What the planner can do.
 *
 * Plan and graph tools are the design: plan prose is edited by block against
 * the revision read, while implementation work is revised beside it against
 * both the plan and graph revisions. Everything else the agent has is a way of
 * looking at the working directory.
 *
 * Tools are built per room, closing over its plan. A session belongs to one
 * room, so there is no id to pass and no way to address another room's document
 * by accident.
